Build a full-stack confession website for Assam Down Town University (ADTU) that is ready for deployment on Vercel.

Requirements:

Branding & UI

Use the ADTU official logo (I will provide a PNG/SVG) as both navbar logo and favicon.

Clean, modern card-based UI with rounded corners, shadows, and smooth hover effects.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Mobile-first, responsive layout.

Color theme: ADTU blue (#004C99), white (#ffffff), and grey (#f5f5f5).

Pages

Home (Feed): Shows a list of anonymous confessions. Each confession card must display:

Confession ID (#001, #002‚Ä¶)

Confession text

Date posted

Reaction buttons (‚ù§Ô∏è üòÇ üî•).

Submit Page: Simple anonymous form (textarea + submit). No login or email required. Submissions go to database.

Categories/Tags: Add dropdown to filter posts (Funny, Crush, Hostel, Sad, Roast, etc.).

Search Bar: Search confessions by keywords.

Admin Page (Private):

Admin login (simple username/password stored in env variables).

Show all pending confessions.

Approve ‚Üí publish to feed OR Delete.

Backend & Database

Use Next.js API routes (no separate server).

Store confessions in MongoDB Atlas (cloud DB).

Schema: { id, text, date, status (pending/approved), tags, reactions }.

Only approved confessions show on feed.

Deployment

Make sure project is Vercel ready:

Add next.config.js.

Include .env.example for MongoDB URI + admin credentials.

All API routes should work on Vercel serverless functions.

Final structure should be:

/pages
  /api
    submit.js
    getConfessions.js
    approve.js
/components
  ConfessionCard.js
  Navbar.js
/public
  adtu-logo.png
  favicon.ico
tailwind.config.js
next.config.js
package.json
.env.example


Extra Features (Optional but Nice)

Dark mode toggle.

Analytics counter (total confessions, total reactions).

Goal

Provide me with clean, production-ready Next.js + Tailwind + MongoDB code that I can:

Save the project from Replit.

Push to GitHub.

Connect repo to Vercel.

Add my .env (MongoDB URI + admin password).

Deploy instantly."*
